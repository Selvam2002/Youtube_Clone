1. **Create a Clone of Youtube website, only using HTML!** âœ¨
   This task involves replicating the layout and design of the YouTube website using only HTML. You can focus on mimicking the structure, layout, and visual elements of the YouTube homepage or any other page on the site.

2. **If you click on play button, the video should play!** âœ¨
   Implement functionality so that when the user clicks on a play button, a video plays. Remember not to use the video tag; instead, use the iframe tag to embed the video from a source like YouTube.

3. **If you click on the YouTube logo, the official YouTube website should open in a new tab.** âœ¨
   Add a feature where clicking on the YouTube logo redirects the user to the official YouTube website, opening it in a new browser tab. This enhances user experience by providing easy access to the original content.

4. **Create a simple form page. When you click on the subscribe button, that form should be displayed!** âœ¨
   Develop a form page containing fields for user input. When the user clicks on the subscribe button, the form should be displayed or expanded, allowing them to enter their details for subscription purposes.
